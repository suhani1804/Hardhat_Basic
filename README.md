hard# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
I have used Goerli testnet, For deploying on the testnet run
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
